# What do we mean by interaction?

We mean every way people experience your business, whether it's the product, service, marketing or communications. Your brand isn't what you say it is. What it is in their minds is what it is.
This philosophy guides everything we do. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ed9dca52-9a58-4bdb-abcd-f96442fc5f91.jpg)
