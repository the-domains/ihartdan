# Mobile Safety App for the real world

Mobile devices out in the field is rising given some of latest improvements in tech , and honestly one of my personal favorites for design. I enjoy bringing the world of hard work, long hours, and harsh outdoor conditions together with the software world. It is here where research and the right design decisions can make an impact or even save a life.

So here's a project I did that is just that. For this project I did User Research, UX Design, and Visual Design.

The Problem:
In an environment where time is of the essence and danger is all around, a over-tedious experience for oil field workers to capture incidents (injury, spill, hazard, repair, etc..) slows down the capturing process. At the time the current workflow for capturing incidents was very inefficient and in some cases even ignored. The timeframe for capturing an incident could be several minutes or even hours could go by before being sent out.

# This created a handful problems.

Fellow field agents in the area are not notified of urgent incidents, or any at all. So responses either didn't happen or we're done through calling or text.
- Every time an incident needed to be captured agents had to go back to their vehicle, open their laptop, and tether their phone for connection.
- The process of capturing an incident was no small task either, it required using a template excel file, creating an email, and in some cases driving around to find a "hotspot" for connection. ...and by hotspot I don't mean a coffee shop. We're talking 1 bar or 2 of data service out in cow patty nation. 

The User:
- Rough and tough
- Works long hours and several days (more than a week) in a row
- Non-Technical
- Drives about 250-300 miles per day
- Wears gloves
- Oh yeah, and they wear sunglasses most of day
\#\#\# Working Conditions:
- Outside in all weather types
- Bright sunlight or complete darkness
- Long Hours
- Extreme temperatures (hot or cold)
- In flammable areas 

Desired outcomes 
- Significantly reduce time of capturing 
- Alert agents in the area of incident event through push notifications
- Capture different types of incidents
- Multiple photos per incident
- Bring users together around incident through conversations in the app
\#\# My Approach to solving 

User Research
As you can probably tell from above, I did my research. I was fortunate enough on this project to see a lot of this in person and talk to people one on one. I did a day trip that consisted of a ride-a-long through several "middle-of-nowhere" locations. Experiencing all of this allowed me to design a solution that would actually be used.

Let's pause there for a second. There is a big difference between conducting research through asking questions, and being able to experience something in person. Always strive for the latter when available.
Along with my user research I also did some light weight user testing as I brought along a lo-fi prototype to get some reactions.

\#\#\# UX Design
I always lean towards designing the whole experience through prototypes as not only is it more realistic to the final product and more iterative, but it also gives users something to play with. I even stayed away from wireframes with annotations for client design reviews. I used Flinto which was great and I enjoyed it, $20/month for the service. Not a bad deal. 

Key objectives of user experience:
- Lean and mean
- Dead simple
- Keep this to only a couple screens
- Make it hard to log a accidental incident (reduce user error)
\[wireframes, whiteboard, etc..\] 

Visual Design
Once I got the experience nailed down enough I got jamming on the visuals. Remember when I mentioned "outside" and "sunglasses"? Well, that is what inspired my visual design approach. Minimal, clean, white, scan-able, and high contrast. Hitting the user over the head with branding and logo's everywhere was not the approach and something I drove the client towards. In this experience, content is truly king.  

Key objectives of the visual design:
- High contrast
- Photography stands out
- Use of iconography versus text
- Use of color indicates status
- Upload success or failure is very prominent
